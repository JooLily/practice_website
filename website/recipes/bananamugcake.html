    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This recipe is a perfect single-serving banana bread that's quick and simple to make with only a few ingredients.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1/2 of an overripe banana</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon vegetable oil</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon milk</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons brown sugar</li>
        <li>1/4 cup all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon baking powder</li>
        <li>1/8 teaspoon cinnamon</li>
        <li>1/8 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>(optional)1 tablespoon chocolate chips</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Pick a mug that is not too tall or too thick. The mug needs to be microwave-safe.</li>
        <li>Cut the overripe banana in half and peel it. Mash the banana into the mug.</li>
        <li>Measure out the wet ingredients (oil and milk) into the mug. Mix together.</li>
        <li>Measure out the flour into a measuring cup. I like to do half flour and half protein powder.</li>
        <li>Measure out the remaining dry ingredients into the measuring cup with the flour.</li>
        <ul>
            <li>The remaining dry ingredients are brown sugar, cinnamon, salt, and baking powder.</li>
            <li>I substitute baking powder with a little bit of lemon juice. I don't know if it works as a substitute on its own, though.</li>
        </ul>
        <li>Mix the dry ingredients with the wet ingredients in the mug, and add in your preferred topping. I prefer oats instead of chocolate chips.</li>
        <li>Scrape down the sides of the mug for even baking.</li>
        <li>Microwave on high for 80-90 seconds.</li>
        <li>Let cool for about a minute and then enjoy!</li>
    </ol>
