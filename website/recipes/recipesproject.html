    <h1>Welcome to my First Coding Project "Recipes" in HTML</h1>
    <p>With this project, I will be practicing everything I have learned with HTML as well as compiling a few recipes I found that I would like to try making.</p>
    <h2>Banana Mug Cake</h2>
    <p>This is the first recipe I would like to try. It's an easy single-serving recipe with only a few ingredients that I can use to make a sweet treat to satisfy my banana bread cravings.</p>

    <h2>Peanut Butter Cookie</h2>
    <p>This next recipe I found on Instagram. It's another single-serving recipe for peanut butter cookies. I love peanut butter :3</p>
